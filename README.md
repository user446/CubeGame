# CubeGame
Simple endless hypercasual game

In this game you have to operate a cube which is endlessly moving forward.  
Controls:  
a — drag cube to left  
d — drag cube to right  

The game places new platforms with obstacles (from predefined list of GameObjects) thus making it endless.  
It is possible to create a platform which will trigger a completion of a level though.
